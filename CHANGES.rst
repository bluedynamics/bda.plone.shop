0.6
---

  [thet]


0.5
---

- Introduce ``IBuyablePeriod`` interface, Implement for AT and DX and include
  checks in buyable controls and cart validation.
  [rnix]

- Implement ``validate_set`` on cart data provider.
  [rnix]

- Change browser view and adapter regitrations from IPloneSiteRoot to
  `zope.component.interfaces.ISite`. That's needed for Lineage compatibility.
  [thet]

- Integrate ``cart_count_limit`` property of cart item data interface.

  for the buyable viewlet.
  [thet]

  turned off in a customized buyable class for shared stock buyables.
  [thet]

- Remove buyable viewlet class, as it did not have any customization in it.
  This should not break backwards compatibility.
  [thet]

- Stick to ``AccessControl`` directly for checking buyable controls
  permissions. ``<SpecialUser 'Anonymous User'>`` instance returned by
  ``plone.api.user.get_current()`` not provides ``checkPermission`` function,
  which makes it useless.

- Introduce ``bda.plone.shop.ViewBuyableInfo`` and ``bda.plone.shop.BuyItems``
  permissions and consider in buyable controls. Now it can be controlled
  whether users can see item pricing and whether they can buy items.
  [rnix]

- Don't register ``bda.plone.shop.buyable`` viewlet for ``IBelowContentBody``
  but only for ``IAboveContentBody`` to avoid displaying it twice. Integrators
  should register it differently if they want to display the viewlet somewhere
  else.
  [thet]

- Integrate discount related stuff.
  [rnix]

- Set ``bda.plone.orders.permissions.DelegateVendorRole`` permission for
  ``Site Administrator`` and ``Manager`` roles in
